# VehicleList

## Requirements
- iOS 14.4
- Xcode 11+
- Swift 5.1+

## External Libraries
- GoogleMaps
- Alamofire

## SetUp

- Clone the project.
- Import the project to xcode.
- Open the workspace directory from terminal and execute `pod install `.
- Build & run the project. 

## Considerations

- Inconsistency on vehicle nickname field. I've decided to replace it with brand and model information on the map view.
- Timestamp wasn't necessary.
- I would considerer paginate table view if I had more than 15 results at least.
